# Spam-Email-Detection

Here are the steps for detecting spam emails using support vector machines (SVMs), grid search, and natural language processing (NLP):

- Collect a dataset of emails: You will need a large dataset of emails, with some labeled as spam and others as non-spam (also known as "ham").

- Preprocess the email data: Preprocessing will involve converting the emails to a format that can be processed by the SVM algorithm, such as a bag-of-words representation. You may also need to remove any stop words or perform stemming.

- Split the dataset into training and testing sets: You will need to split the dataset into a training set and a testing set so that you can evaluate the performance of the model on unseen data.

- Use grid search to find the best hyperparameters for the SVM: Use grid search to find the best combination of hyperparameters for the SVM, such as the kernel type and regularization strength.

- Train the SVM model: Train the SVM model on the training set using the best hyperparameters found in step 4.

- Test the SVM model: Evaluate the performance of the SVM model on the testing set.

- Use the trained SVM model to classify new emails as spam or non-spam: Once you have a trained and tested SVM model, you can use it to classify new emails as spam or non-spam.
